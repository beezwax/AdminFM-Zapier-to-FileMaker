## Zapier integration for FileMaker's Admin API

### What is AdminFM?

AdminFM is a tool built for Zapier that allows you to integrate your FileMaker Server's Admin API to a host of other tools available at [Zapier](https://www.zapier.com).

Built with Node.js using Zapier's Command Line Interface, AdminFM follows the [developer guidelines](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform-cli) provided by Zapier. The intention is to provide a tool to help FileMaker developers use Zapier to create integrations between FileMaker's Admin API and a host of other services provided by Zapier, such as Gmail, Slack, WordPress, Shopify, MailChimp, DropBox, et.al.

### Beta Programs

AdminFM is in beta testing as a Zapier app (aka a "Zap"). To use the beta version, please visit [this link](https://zapier.com/platform/public-invite/2422/230a66c7511ecf74e3f647d1511fe48a/) to create a Zapier account and accept the beta invitation.

The FileMaker 17 Admin API is considered a [FileMaker trial feature](https://community.filemaker.com/docs/DOC-8766), subject to changes and improvements, and future upgrades to FileMaker to continue functioning.
